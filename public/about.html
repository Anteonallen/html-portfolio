<h1>About Me</h1>
<p>I seek to apply the skills and knowledge gained during self learning on Udemy and FreeCodeCamp to become a web developer. 
  Prior to my learning experience to coding I was working as an Assistant Architect, an engineering job that is related to water and flooding design with AutoCAD, 
  and Swept Path Analysis with AutoTURN when I was working at a Traffic company.
  My goal is helping you to solve problems as a freelancer.</p>
